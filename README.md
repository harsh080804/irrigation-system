This project implements an IoT-based irrigation system that automates the watering of crops based on real-time soil moisture data. 
By integrating sensors, a microcontroller (like Arduino or NodeMCU), and cloud services, the system ensures efficient water usage and supports remote monitoring via a mobile or web interface. 
This smart irrigation solution aims to promote sustainable agriculture by reducing water waste and improving crop health.
